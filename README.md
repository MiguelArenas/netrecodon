NetRecodon simulates nucleotide and codon sequences from haploid/diploid populations with intra/inter codon recombination, migration, demographics and dated tips. NetRecodon can simulate DNA alignments under a large variety of nucleotide (JC, K80, HKY, F81, SYM, GTR, GTnR) and codon (GY94 x M0, M1, M7 and M8) +I +G substitution models.
